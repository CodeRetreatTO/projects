# Sudoku
##### In various languages

- The Haskell, Python and Lisp are self-contained
- The JS version was written in the Chromium prompt, and so uses an HTML file to include underscore
- The Lisp version was the first one done; I played around with it for a few hours the week before the code retreat day
- The other three were done as part of the event
- None of them actually work in the general case (the Python attempt doesn't even work in any specific case)
